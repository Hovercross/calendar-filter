# Calendar filter

## Purpose

I have both a personal and a work calendar on my iPhone. When I have a personal event during the day, I block it on my work calendar as "personal time" using Google's out-of-office filter. I don't want these "personal time" events to show up on my phone. This package will proxy requests between Google and my iPhone and remove the "personal time" events.

This will probably make my iPhone read only for my work calendar, but that is fine - I can edit things as needed from the Google Calendar app. I just want all my meetings to show up on my watch.
